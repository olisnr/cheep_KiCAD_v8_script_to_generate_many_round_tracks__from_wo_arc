how to use:

change the parameters in mm

as example:
if You want to make a hole circle from 180 tracks, and 52 round 90Â° traces in a 600um grid,
starting from the biggest radius at 99.3mm, then run the script with:

points_per_circle =     180
radius_start =          99.3
radius_delta =          -.6
arcs =                  52
